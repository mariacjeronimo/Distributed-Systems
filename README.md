# Distributed-Systems
- Project 1:
  The overall objective of the project is to implement a resource lock manager for read and write operations (read–write locks). Its purpose is to control access to a set of shared resources in a distributed system,      where different clients may concurrently request access to them.
  
- Project 2:
  Project 2 is a continuation of Project 1, in which it addressed three limitations related to its organization, performance, and reliability.
  
- Project 3:
  The overall objective of this project is to implement a Web service to manage a simplified user music rating system. The implementation will use the REST architectural style [1] and a relational database accessed      through the SQL language. For this purpose, the Flask Web development framework [2] and the SQLite SQL database engine [3] will be used on the server. The client program will use the requests module [4] to implement   HTTP-based client–server interaction.

- Project 4:
  Project 4 is a continuation of Project 3, with focus on security measures for the previous project. In the third project, a Web service was implemented to manage a simplified user music rating system. For this         purpose, the Flask Web development framework and the SQLite SQL database engine were used on the server. The client program uses the requests module to implement HTTP-based client–server interaction.
